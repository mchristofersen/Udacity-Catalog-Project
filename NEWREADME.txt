--Introduction--
This project is an item catalog made for Udacity's full-stack web developer
program. Its focus is in implementing C.R.U.D. operations (create, read,
update, and delete), as well as using third-party OAuth (google+). Once
a user is logged in they can post new items, as well as edit or delete them.
Items can be viewed regardless of login status.
